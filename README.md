# Week-2-Assignment : Data Pre-processing

Objective:

The purpose of this assignment is to test understanding of data pre-processing techniques in Python. I will be required to demonstrate proficiency in handling datasets, cleaning data, and preparing it for further analysis.

Dataset:

For this assignment,the Heart Disease dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease) is used. The dataset contains information on various attributes related to heart disease, such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, and cholesterol levels. The goal is to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient based on these attributes.
